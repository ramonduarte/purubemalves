# Pré-Universitário Comunitário Rubem Alves

### Management and communications for Pré-Universitário Comunitário Rubem Alves and its activities.

This project consists of two different set of apps:

#### **Admin apps**

##### _Using django-admin powerful out-of-the box tools, their goals are to automate menial tasks that used to be done manually, as well as provide a thorough, yet seamless grasp on the organization's resources._

##### - `alunos`

Link `Users` and `Alunos`/`Voluntários` together for tighter control and usability enhancements.

##### - `controle_de_frequencia`

Provide attendance control for both students and volunteers at the organization. 

##### - `home`

Will allow prospective students to fill in applications to enroll on the organization (still unoperational).

##### - `issues`

Will make GitHub's issue control easier to use by laypeople users (still unoperational).

##### - `politicas_afirmativas`

Will help students to successfully organize and hand in documents for affirmative actions (still unoperational).

##### - `projeto_redacao`

Provide a centralized interface for composition teachers to build and share knowledge about their students' progress, as well as an overview of the student body performance.

##### - `website`

Started out as a simple application to handle the organization's most basic needs, but has grown to become the main management tool in the kit. It is the core of the whole software, concatenating database bindings to most of the controllers plugs. Also handles enrollment, library management, syllabus control, and human resources.

#### **Interface apps**

##### _Custom-made views fill in the blanks where django-admin falls short, providing unique tools to the organization that are easy to reuse and adapt to multiple screens._

##### - `alunos`

Provide a powerful interface for students to check on their progress, overview their library borrowings, and review their affirmative actions applications.

##### - `controle_de_frequencia`

Exhibit a streamlined interface for attendance control, meant to be easier to use in multiple devices and offline environments.

##### - `home`

Stamp the organization's branding on the web with a simple website containing its most important informations and contacts.

##### - `politicas_afirmativas`

Will help students to successfully organize and hand in documents for affirmative actions (still unoperational).

##### - `website`

Provide HTTP tools that are globally useful to the organization.


## Team

This entire piece of software was built by myself, personally, with thousands of contributions from the open source community. Development started as a self-challenge, then as a way to learn web and django standards, then it progressed as the organization's coordinators embraced and strongly supported my efforts. 

A personal thank note to my most avid testers:

1. Marcus Vinícius de Oliveira Coimbra (@marcuscoimbra) 
2. Guilherme 
3. Luiz Henrique

## Resources

All of this software's development was support by myself, only, using open source tools, or closed source tools licensed to my personal use. I have never charged for it, nor have any intention to do so.

This software's cloud deployment is hosted by Digital Ocean and currently paid for by the organization. It is available on the web at the address https://purubemalves.com.br which is provided by UOL Host (via Registro.br) and also currently paid for by the organization.
